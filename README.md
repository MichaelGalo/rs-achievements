# Purpose

This is a personal project of mine, where I intend on practicing data analytics and visualization with a game that I've enjoyed for years: Runescape. There are many long grinds & soul-crushing achievement lengths, which is why I've decided to visualize my progress for my main account.

## Public URL

Currently this site is under development and isn't publicly available. When it releases, the URL link will be placed here.

## Want your own?

Currently this isn't easily done, but soon I hope to give a thorough walk-through on how to input your own data points in order to make this possible. It will require some basic understanding on cloning a repo & inputting data into the .json files. All in all, it will be simple - though a bit scary for muggles that have never used a terminal.

## For Curious Devs

I'm intentionally not creating a back-end (what would have been likely a django/python API), primarily due to hosting cost concerns. I'd like to practice CI/CD via GitHub Actions, which I've used seldomly to serve static sites.

Also with the (soon tm) release of the RuneScape API, I thought it might be easier to focus on the front-end and hopefully connect fetch calls to their API for dynamically rendered data vs. static data in the future.
